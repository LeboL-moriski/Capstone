    "The purpose of this project is to analyze the physico-chemical parameters of a polluted river located in Buenos Aires, with a focus on identifying trends, correlations, and potential health or environmental risks. The project aims to utilize data collected from various sampling points to better understand the pollution levels and their impacts on water quality.\n",

    "* **Introduce:**\n",
    "Water pollution is a significant environmental issue in many urban areas, including Buenos Aires, where industrial, agricultural, and domestic activities contribute to the contamination of nearby rivers. The physico-chemical parameters of river water, such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS), provide vital information about the water quality and its suitability for human consumption, aquatic life, and ecological health. By examining these parameters over time and across different locations, this project seeks to uncover patterns of contamination and inform potential mitigation strategies.\n",

    "Data exploration and cleaning: Data Exploration and Cleaning: Organize and clean the data, addressing any missing values or inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.\n",
    "Trend Analysis: Analyze how key physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and total suspended solids change over time and across different sampling locations.\n",
    "Correlation Study: Identify relationships between different environmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, and pH) and how they influence the river's contamination levels.\n",
    "Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict water quality based on various environmental factors and sampling data.\n",
    "Recommendations for Environmental Management: Provide actionable insights and recommendations for improving water quality, including identifying critical pollution sources and suggesting mitigation measures."

    "The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and is the result of a collaborative research effort by three university researchers from Argentina. The research team collected water samples from a widely known polluted river located in Buenos Aires. These samples were taken from various sampling points along the river, including **Puente_Bilbao**, **Puente_Irigoyen**, and **Puente_Falbo**, and analyzed in a chemistry laboratory to measure several physico-chemical parametenent.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "- **Columns**: 32\r\n",
    "  - **Decimal values**: 14 columns (representing numerical values like temperature, pH, EC, TDS, and TSS).\r\n",
    "  - **Integer values**: 10 columns (representing variables like time, sample counts, or other measurements).\r\n",
    "  - **String values**: 6 columns (including sampling point names and other categorical data).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The data is **chronologically sorted**, ensuring that the time sequence of the samples is preserved. This enables the identification of trends and variations over time, which is crucial for analyzing changes in water quality and the impac of pollution.\r\n",

    "#### Sampling Points\r\n",
    "The dataset includes water samples collected from three key sampling points located along the river:\r\n",
